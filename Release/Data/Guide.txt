Getting started/Example:
		The files given are for the following:
			In WFAllocInit: Servers named Warframe-Srvxx.
				Warframe-Srv11
				Warframe-Srv12
				Warframe-Srv13
				Warframe-Srv14
			We are running 4 game modes:
				DM Variant
				DM Variant RC
				TDM Variant
				TDM Variant RC
			GameModeNames are set to work with the settings in the WFServerConfig app ("Set config" button)
			WFAllocDisplayNames are set for current game modes, but unused for now (for discord bot)
			
			ServerLogin it set to connect to localhost, change this to allocator ip/hostname (in info\server\ip.dat)
			
			Encryption keys
				Easiest is to:
					take Data\info\testPublic and put it in WFServerLogin\info\[version]Public
					take Data\info\testPrivate and put it in WFAllocManager\info\[version]Private
				
		
Details:
	Check encryption keys:
		in WFServerLogin: info\[version]Public exists, eg "info\0.1.2Public", no extension
		in WFAllocManager:	info\[version]Private exists
		can take test keys from Data\info (rename appropriately)
		
	Set Allocation behavior:
		scripts\WFAllocInit.txt: Entry point + set connectors for every server.
			For successfull connection, the server connecting to the allocator has to be registered with the allocator first.
		scripts\WFAllocGameModes.txt: Set modes to run
			So -config -mode 7 406013 0 => region = 7 (EU), gameModeId = 406013 (TDM_Alt_Title), eloRating = 0 (RC enabled)
			Right now, it allocates the alternative modes. Without events, they shut down automatically after 5 minutes. Good for testing.
				change in WFAllocScriptInit
		scripts\WFAllocGameModeNames.txt: map names ([regionId]-[gameModeId]-[eloRating]) to setting in DS.cfg on the servers (should be good when set with WFConfigManager)
		scripts\WFAllocDisplayNames.txt: basically, define replacements for internal names to readable text ("406014" to "FFA Variant" etc)
		
	Set ServerLogin
		Theres 3 options:
			ip: ip address or hostname for allocator
			port: port to use, default 11024
			name: the name used by the server to identify the connection, default is their hostname.
		you set them by creating a file in the info folder, so for ip, you would create "info\server\ip.dat" with contents "Warframe-Srv11"
		
		
		
		
	Allocator management:
		You can run commands in the allocator. These are the same commands as in the scriptsType help for latest options
			-state => Get state of instances. Example -state
			-console => Add remote console. Example: -console -connect -ip MyServer -port 12345
			-script => Run scripts. Examples:
				-script -run path\to\scriptfile.txt
				-script -set option
				-script -if option -run script.txt
			-troll => system.console.internal.test
			-config => Manage settings. Examples:
				-config -timer -updateDelay 120000 (check state and start/stop instances every 2 minutes)
				-config -log -enable (-enable or -disable)
				-config -set gameModeId 406014-0 SpDMAltRC
				-config -mode 406014 0
				-config -connect -name MyServer -instances 24
				-config -connect -remove -name OldServer
				-config -listen -port 11024
			-perf => Check performance of servers. Example: -perf
			-status => Get status overview. Example -status
			-var => Set variables. Example: -var -set exe C:\Program Files\Warframe\Downloaded\Public\Warframe.x64.exe
			-update => Update the state and perform actions on the state. Example -update
			-test => Tests
